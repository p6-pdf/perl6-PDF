If an ICCBased color space is specified, it must provide calibration information appropriate for the process color components specified in the names array of the DeviceN color space.
    has PDF::COS::Name @.Components is entry(:required); # (Required) An array of component names that correspond, in order, to the components of the process color space specified in ColorSpace. For example, an RGB color space must have three names corresponding to red, green, and blue. The names may be arbitrary (that is, not the same as the standard names for the color space components) and must match those specified in the names array of the DeviceN color space, even if all components are not present in the names array.

For each entry, the key is a colorant name, and the value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. This dictionary need not contain entries for all colorants used in this color space; it may also include additional colorants not used by this color space.

An entry with a key of Default specifies a value to be used by all components in the associated DeviceN color space for which a solidity value is not explicitly provided. If Default is not present, the default value for unspecified colorants is 0.0; applications may choose to use other values.

Each component in the names array of the DeviceN color space must appear in this array (although the order is unrelated to the order specified in the names array). This entry may also list colorants unused by this specific DeviceN instance.
    has Numeric $.DotGain is entry;  # (Optional) A dictionary specifying the dot gain of inks to be used in blending calculations when used as an alternative to the tint transformation function. Dot gain (or loss) represents the amount by which a printerâ€™s halftone dots change as the ink spreads and is absorbed by paper.
        # For each entry, the key is a colorant name, and the value is a function that maps values in the range 0 to 1 to values in the range 0 to 1. The dictionary may list colorants unused by this specific DeviceN instance and need not list all colorants. An entry with a key of Default specifies a function to be used by all colorants for which a dot gain function is not explicitly specified.
        # PDF consumer applications may ignore values in this dictionary when other sources of dot gain information are available, such as ICC profiles associated with the process color space or tint transformation functions associated with individual colorants.
