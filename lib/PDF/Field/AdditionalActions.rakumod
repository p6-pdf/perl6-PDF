has PDF::Action $.K is entry(:alias<change>);    #= (Optional; PDF 1.3) A JavaScript action that is performed when the user modifies a character in a text field or combo box or modifies the selection in a scrollable list box. This action may check the added text for validity and reject or modify it.

has PDF::Action $.F is entry(:alias<format>);    #= (Optional; PDF 1.3) A JavaScript action that is performed before the field is formatted to display its value. This action may modify the field’s value before formatting.

has PDF::Action $.V is entry(:alias<validate>);  #= (Optional; PDF 1.3) A JavaScript action that is performed when the field’s value is changed. This action may check the new value for validity.

has PDF::Action $.C is entry(:alias<calculate>); #= (Optional; PDF 1.3) A JavaScript action that is performed to recalculate the value of this field when that of another field changes. (The name C stands for “calculate.”) The order in which the document’s fields are recalculated is defined by the CO entry in the interactive form dictionary
