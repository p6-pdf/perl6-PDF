has PDF::COS::Stream $.CIDSet is entry; # (Optional) A stream identifying which CIDs are present in the CIDFont file. If this entry is present, the CIDFont shall contain only a subset of the glyphs in the character collection defined by the CIDSystemInfo dictionary. If it is absent, the only indication of a CIDFont subset shall be the subset tag in the FontName entry. The streamâ€™s data shall be organized as a table of bits indexed by CID. The bits shall be stored in bytes with the high-order bit first. Each bit shall correspond to a CID. The most significant bit of the first byte shall correspond to CID 0, the next bit to CID 1, and so on.
