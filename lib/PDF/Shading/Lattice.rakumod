has UInt $.BitsPerCoordinate is entry(:required);	# [integer] (Required) The number of bits used to represent each vertex coordinate. The value is 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, or 32.
has UInt $.BitsPerComponent is entry(:required);  # (Required) The number of bits used to represent each color component. Valid values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16.
has UInt $.VerticesPerRow is entry(:required);    # (Required) The number of vertices in each row of the lattice; the value must be greater than or equal to 2.
has Numeric @.Decode is entry(:required);         # (Required) An array of numbers specifying how to map vertex coordinates and color components into the appropriate ranges of values
has PDF::Function @.Function is entry(:array-or-item);   # (Optional) A 1-in, n-out function or an array of n 1-in, 1-out functions (where n is the number of color components in the shading dictionaryâ€™s color space).
